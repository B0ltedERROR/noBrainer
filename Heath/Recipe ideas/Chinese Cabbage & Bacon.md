## Ingredients

- 1.4 lb (640 grams) of Cabbage
    
- 1.5 tbsp of [black vinegar](https://amzn.to/3vKT90C)
    
- 8-10 pieces of dry chillies, seeded and cut in half
    
- 4 cloves of garlic, sliced thinly
    
- 1 tsp of salt, or to taste
    
- 2 tsp of [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/2K74juD)
    
- 2-3 tbsp of vegetable oil to stir fry


## Directions

1. Cut the cabbage in half. Remove the hard center stem. Tear the cabbage into small sizes. If the cabbage is too solid to break apart by hand, you can cut it with a knife instead.
    
2. Thinly slice a few cloves of garlic
    
3. Cut 8-10 pieces of red dried chilies into half-inch long pieces. Remove the seeds and set it aside.
    
4. Add some vegetable oil to a heated wok. Toss in the cabbage along with the garlic and dried chilies. Stir over high heat for a couple of minutes or until the cabbage is welted down.
    
5. Add 2 tsp of soy sauce, 1 tsp of salt or to taste, and 1 tbsp of Chinese black vinegar. Continue to stir for a minute. Turn off the heat. Before serving, add the remaining black vinegar and mix. This will stabilize the flavor Because the vinegar we add before evaporated a little bit during cooking.
