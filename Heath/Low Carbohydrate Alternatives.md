### Pasta
I eat pasta often with the family and if I can add a simple solution for them to substitute for just me or for everyone that would be preferable.

Spaghetti Squash is a no go. Don't really like it. texture is just way to mushy and fibrous.

Cucumber and zucchini could do. We do have a vegetable spiralizer tool but I'm curious about cook methods. I suspect it will have to be a blanched or marinaded. 

Many vegetables can be spiralized, but the most popular are zucchini, carrots, turnips, beets and cucumbers.

#### Cabbage Noodles
[[Chinese Cabbage & Bacon]]

''' Few people consider using cabbage as a noodle replacement, but it’s a deceivingly simple substitute.

At around 6 grams of carbs per 3.5 ounces (100 grams), it’s especially low in carbs. Incredibly, this quantity of cabbage provides 54% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for [vitamin C](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-c-benefits) and 85% of the RDI for vitamin K.

Cabbage is also a good source of folate and boasts an array of other vitamins and minerals ([15](https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2371/2)).

You can use whole cabbage leaves as a substitute for lasagna sheets. Alternatively, chop the cabbage head into thin noodles to use in a pad thai or lo mein. Keep in mind that the leaves closest to the core are very tough and can be bitter.

Once cut, drop the [cabbage](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-cabbage) into boiling water for approximately two minutes.

If used for lasagna, the cabbage leaves will be ready when they can be easily bent without breaking. They will cook further in the oven, so don’t boil them for too long.

If you’re using cabbage noodles for anything other than an oven dish, remove them from the water when soft enough to pierce with a fork. '''
